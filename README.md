# üöÄ FastAPI Mongo Starter

A minimal FastAPI application powered by **MongoDB** and **Valkey (Redis-compatible cache)**, secured with **JWT authentication**, containerized with **Docker**, and orchestrated using **Docker Compose**.

---

## üåê Core Functionality

* ‚ö° **User Signup & Login**: Register and authenticate users with email and password.
* üîê **JWT Authentication**: Secure protected routes using access tokens.
* üîç **Get Current User**: Retrieve user details using a valid JWT token, with cache fallback using Valkey.
* üöÄ **Valkey Caching**: Improves performance by caching user data in Valkey (a Redis-compatible cache).
* üß© **Async I/O**: Fully asynchronous using `motor` (MongoDB async driver) and `redis.asyncio` for cache.
* üì¶ **Containerized**: FastAPI, MongoDB, and Valkey run in isolated containers.
* üîß **Service Orchestration**: Docker Compose handles setup, networking, and service orchestration automatically.
* üì° **NGINX Load Balancer**: Routes and balances traffic across 3 FastAPI instances using round-robin strategy.
* üîí **Self-Signed SSL (HTTPS)**: NGINX serves traffic over HTTPS using self-signed SSL certificates.
* üîê **Environment Configuration**: Secrets and config loaded securely using `.env` and `python-dotenv`.

## üê≥ Run the App

```bash
docker-compose up --build
```

The app will be accessible at:

```
https://localhost
```

> ‚ö†Ô∏è You may need to accept the security warning in your browser due to the self-signed SSL certificate.

NGINX will route requests to one of the 3 FastAPI instances running behind it.
